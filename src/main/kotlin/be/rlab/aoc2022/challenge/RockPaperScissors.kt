/** This is the classic Rock-Paper-Scissors game with some specific rules.
 *
 * I think the key part of the challenge is how to model the problem in a way it can be used
 * for the two parts. I used an enum to model the Shapes (rock, paper and scissor), and another
 * enum to model the Result (lose, draw and win).
 *
 * Each Shape has a weight that represents which one wins against the other. At the same time, each Result know what's
 * the outcome of a match between two Shapes. A match result is the difference between Shape's weights, and all the
 * combinations are cached/stored in the matchResults field. So, in order to resolve a Result, it just needs to
 * subtract weights and search for the enum element containing the value in the matchResults field.
